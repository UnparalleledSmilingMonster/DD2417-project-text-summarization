{"summary": "Suited to its purpose, if not quite its goal...", "text": "If you like the classic taste of a good margarita, it's likely you'll find Baja Bob's Margarita Mix to be an acquired taste at best and a cruel joke at worst.  Not that it tastes horrible, but like most contests between similar products that are sugar-based and sugar-free, the recipe for which you already have a preference is going to win despite the competition's particular and sometimes overwhelming merits.  Since I've decided to limit my sugar intake but not my affection for margaritas, this tequila mixer is best suited to take care of the problem, so I've decided to stick with it and learn to like it.  Over time I've at least grown accustomed to the taste (adding extra Triple Sec helps), even if I can't say it's the best improvement to margaritas since the salt rimmed glass.  Splenda certainly works better in some things than others.  In this case it's a qualified success with taste taking a subjective second place to functionality.  I don't love it or hate it, but I don't miss the sugar either.  To that end Baja Bob's Margarita Mix does what it's supposed to do very well. TL;DR: "}

It reminded me more of the amount of sweetness you'd get from dark chocolate rather than something as sweet as Cocoa Puffs or other chocolate cereals. For some people, this might be appealing; however, for people with an intense sweet tooth, this might not satisfy you. I didn't really have the problem of it getting soggy like other reviewers mentioned, but I eat fast, so maybe I just never let it sit long enough to get to that point.<br /><br />As a snack, I was even less satisfied. I could taste the dry cocoa powder more than I could taste chocolate flavor. It definitely is best as a cereal (again, I realize that's what it was intended for, but so many cereals are great snacks too) because the milk takes away some of that powder-y texture and flavor.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because it wasn't horrible, but it's not something I would buy again or recommend to others.

Bob's Red Mill has the best since I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking. I know many people do rinse but I never saw the need for it since it comes clean and that is why Bob charges more. Others claim that their quinoa is clean but it is not true. I keep the unused portion in a zip lock freezer bag in the freezer and take what I need on weekly basis. I consume so much that I never have to worry about it going rancid and unlike brown rice which looses its oil in six months and has starch and goes rancid, quinoa will go for years. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which a healthy diet is all about. It is great with salads as well and is gluten free.

The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.

First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any \"I am sorry for your inconvenience\" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware. TL;DR: "}

Definitely more difficult than I wanted when trying to feed my little one on the go. I needed an easier option, and found it in these Mashups pouches. No utensils needed. No refrigeration needed (though they're great chilled, or even partly frozen, during the summer months).

I love how high-quality they are, and that they have a high-yield and are organic. Most people who have never sprouted before may not realize that you can't use regular seeds from the garden center of a store to sprout. It takes specialty seeds. I have a huge pantry and am well-stocked-up on most everything we use on a regular basis. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily planning for Armageddon, but having food and water storage makes a lot of sense to our family. When my husband lost his job years ago, we had plenty to eat and used cash resources to survive til he got another job. Sprouts are a great way of providing optimum nutrition for your family, take almost no space, are always grown and eaten fresh and can be grown on a countertop or dresser or anyplace warm enough for you to be...no special equipment is needed--you can use a jelly jar if you want to. I have EasySprout sprouters, which make it easy because you can also use the container and snap the lid on it to refrigerate after the seeds have sprouted. They sell these sprouters here on amazon for about $12 and they are a great deal. This particular blend of seeds are very high in protein...so if you are wanting to go vegetarian or just cut down on your meat consumption, this blend is a great choice. I also sprout other things, like seeds and grains and put them into favorite family recipes. Very cheap, nutritious, green/earth-friendly and tasty. The added benefit for me personally is that my 6 yr old sprouts in her own sprouter and she is excited to eat what she grows!!

Most of the graham crackers on the market contain high fructose corn syrup, so it is nice to have this product as an option that contains only natural sweeteners (Midel is another natural brand but sometimes hard to find).  These crackers are also healthier in that they do not contain partially hydrogenated oils, with safflower oil listed as the oil ingredient (2.5 g fat per 2 full cracker sheet serving).  Decent source of fiber (2 g) and fairly high sugar (7 g) per serving.<br /><br />I have tried making homemade graham crackers but could not get a proper texture, so I am sticking to store-bought for now.

{"summary": "Great alternative to sodas and energy drinks", "text": "I'm not a coffee drinker, but am used to having a caffeine fix in the morning. Until recently I was used to having a Diet Coke each morning, but wasn't really thrilled about the chemicals that diet soda packs. I was already a fan of the V8 Fusion drinks, so when I found out about V-8's Fusion + Energy drinks, I was thrilled to have a better option available.<br /><br />Unlike the 100% juice V8 Fusion drinks, the V8 Fusion + Energy drinks combine the fruit and vegetable juices with green tea, so you get a hefty dose of caffeine in addition to a full serving of fruits and veggies (and the vitamins that come with it) in one 50-calorie serving. The green tea does alter the taste quite a lot from the non-caffeinated V8 Fusion drinks, but it's still pretty tasty, especially the Peach Mango flavor.<br /><br />One thing that's worth pointing out is that this little can has quite a bit more caffeine than a can of diet soda, so you may need to modify the amount of caffeine you take in later in the day. Most of the time, one can has all the caffeine I need for the day.<br /><br />These V8 Fusion + Energy drinks are a great tasting, and mostly healthy, alternative to diet sodas as well as the crazy chemical/stimulant concoctions like Red Bull and Monster. If you've got to have that caffeine fix, you might as well get some vitamins with it! TL;DR: "}

It's only that after first buying this brand, I then ran across real, honest to goodness deer antlers that were comparable to these in every way at a local pet store for almost exactly half the price of these.

Not too oily, but rich and dark. I had to try a cup as soon as my package arrived so I pulled out the grinder and set the grind to course (I will expand on this later).  I put 4 Tbsp in my coffee press and added 16 oz of water. 4 minutes later, my new best friend was there to great me.  The 2mm dark brown foam stayed on top as I poured the coffee for both my wife and myself. She added pure sugar and some frothed milk and I, usually taking my coffee the same as hers, decided to try the coffee uninhibited. We both drew the cups to our noses and took in the new aromas as they were much different than any we have had here in California.  The taste was full, but without any bitterness. We immediately knew that we have found our new staple to our morning wake up.<br /><br />Service<br />  Before sending off $50 to Italy for coffee I had never heard of,  I checked out their great website and even shot off a quick email inquiring of grinding recommendations for this higher quality bean/roast.  Within 6 hours, I had received an extensive email back detailing the desired grinds ( and amounts ) for drip, press and espresso.  To top it off, the emails came from the Bomrad family. This, in my opinion, is a family who takes great pride in their product and their name, not to mention raising the bar extremely high in terms of of customer service.<br /><br />Value,<br />  I was hesitant to spend $50+ on 1kg of coffee until my wife reminded me that I drop that on a bottle of Cab at dinner all the time.  I agreed and then ordered.  For us, the coffee was worth every $$.  If you enjoy great art, wine, or culinary delights; you have spent hundreds of dollars to give yourself the best.  With Caffe Bomrad, you only need to spend an extra 10 cents a cup more to give yourself the best coffee/espresso you can serve yourself.  Enjoy. TL;DR: "}

{"summary": "Salsa of the Month was Great!", "text": "I just received The Salsa of the Month Club package and everything was great!  I was excited to try two new salsas from different specialty companies that I would've never been able to try.  They arrived in a sturdy box with foam packing peanuts.  I admit that I was a little nervous that they wouldn't arrive safely, but the glass jars were completely fine.  They were even accompanied by a newsletter giving some background about the salsas and the companies who made them.  They both looked so good, it was hard to decide which one to open first!  My wife and I decided to open the Pink's Mild Salsa from Pennsylvania to accompany our fajitas that we were making for dinner.  It was bold, fresh and made with minimal ingredients and also contained no allergens.  Medically, my wife has to follow a Gluten Free diet, so we are always concerned with allergens and trying to eat foods closer to nature.  A few days later we opened the second salsa (after scraping the first jar dry) and were equally impressed!  The second jar was a Picante Salsa from Hillside Orchard farms in Georgia and was very flavorful and had some visibly large cilantro pieces (my favorite), but was not as chunky as the other one.  This one was great to pour over tacos, as it had more of a sauce consistency, but it was a little harder to pick up with a chip.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I'm looking forward to next month's salsas!  This was the perfect gift for us and would highly recommend the Salsa of the Month Club! TL;DR: "}

Our three cats don't love this \"dental diet cat food\" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.

My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is \"sub-par\" compared to the \"very top\" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company.

As a long time Jelly Belly connoisseur, I would attest that these are indeed real Jelly Belly jellybeans, but there are 3 differences I have found between this jar and the smaller bags that you can purchase at your local supermarket:<br /><br />1. These beans do not have the little \"Jelly Belly\" white logo stamped on the beans.<br /><br />2. These beans come in 49 flavors as opposed to the regular 30 or 39 flavors that the assorted store bags come in. This might attest to the \"What was that flavor? These taste different than the supermarket beans\" claims of some reviewers. (Officially, the Jelly Belly website lists 50 official flavors. Anyone know which flavor was left out of this jar? :)<br /><br />3. Most importantly, I've noticed that the distribution of the assorted flavors seems less uniform in these big jars. I'm about 1/2 way through a jar and have yet to find a peach, Dr. Pepper, caramel corn or cappuccino and have only had a few buttered popcorn, juicy pear and top banana, but there seems to be a lot more of lemon, lime, orange and cherry. Understandably, it makes sense that the more exotic and probably more expensive to produce flavors are included less frequently in such a large, economy priced jar.<br /><br />Otherwise, these are as real as I can tell and there is still a pretty good assortment of flavors, just don't expect a lot of buttered popcorn...

{"summary": "If made right, it's the best!", "text": "You have to make this cake right for it to turn out it's best. I used this mix for my son's Birthday party. Everyone had cake and enjoyed it. They were all surprised to find out that it was Gluten(wheat), Soy, Milk, Egg and Nut Free. I do say that I make my own fronsting and that can a big difference on taste. My son is allergic to Milk, Soy, Wheat, Eggs and Nuts. When you cook without these ingredients it make's standard baking practices even harder. Here's what I've experienced. First, cooking in a Stainless steel baking pan will cook the cake much better(aluminum is fine as well). I've tried glass and the cakes never cook all the way through and come out dense. Second, the butter substitute mixture is important. I've tried the mixture of someone that made a review on the Chocolate Cake mix(thank you whoever you are). I agree using a 1/4 cup Olive Oil and a 1/4 cup coconut oil is the best. But make sure you use the right oils. The Coconut Oil should be Unrefined and Virgin if you like a slight coconut taste(and I mean slight taste, if none at all depending on where you buy the oil from). The Olive oil is the same. Some manufactures have a stronger taste then others. I use \"365\" or \"Spectrum\" Coconut oil, Unrefined, Virgin. You'll have to try out a couple different Olive Oils. I used \"365\" Spanish Olive Oil. Baking variations vary even for standard baking. Hopefully this will help someone. Please post if you figure something good out. Good luck and happy baking.<br /><br />P.S. My apologies, I made a change to my review. I put 1/2 cup and I meant a 1/4 cup. I made the correction now. And I found one downside on this cake mix.

{"summary": "Perfect!", "text": "These Elk Splits are the perfect chew for any dog. They have no discernible odor to humans, yet my dog knew exactly what to do with it. Unlike commercially sold bones, this has no grease to mess up carpets or flooring. It does not splinter, so it is good for small or large dogs. These come not split for larger dogs, but I have found that the split antlers are best for my 20 pound puppy. He got his first split antler when he was only 5 pounds, and knew what to do with it, and loved it. Helped through the teething stage. Bought one for every room, and when he went after something, or me, to chew on, I would distract him with his antler. It worked! These are supposedly humanely \"found\" as deer and elk shed their antlers every year. I hope this is true, as you can't believe everything you read on the internet, but it does make sense! As they can make money doing nothing but finding cutting, and bagging these to sell. They aren't cheap, but they do last a long time. After the marrow has been chewed out, the antler can still be gnawed on, and will harmlessly flake off, and like bone, can be eaten. When the antler gets smaller, it should be replaced with a new one, as it could be swallowed whole in a smaller size. These have lasted for weeks! So the expense in my mind is well worth it. They do sell it by the weight of the dog, but use your common sense. A smaller one is not going to be any softer, than a larger one. The larger one will last longer than a smaller one, as long as it is not so large that the dog can't pick it up and carry it around. Hope these are around for a very long time. TL;DR: "}

Since I thought Emeril's Big Easy bold was surprisingly decent, I thought this would be a decaf version- but its not even close.  Maybe its me, but I've sampled a half dozen decaf dark roasts, and this one is the worst of the bunch.  During brewing it starts off dark, but quickly becomes watery, lacking body.  The resulting drink tastes to me like someone ran the water trough the coffee twice, and I'm drinking the second cup. TL;DR: "}

Let's leave the animals in their cardboard wheeled-cage and remind ourselves what makes the Oreo legendary.<br /><br />A crisp chocolate cookie that explodes in your mouth like a fistful of gravel - which in more-is-better-America is a good thing - only to be subdued by a generous dollop of stiff, whipped, sweet vanilla-like cream, bound together in a delightful chocolate and vanilla tango of sugary goodness, amid an audible ground-glass crunch. I may just need a cigarette.<br /><br />The new Peanut Butter creme Oreo Fudge creme is a delicious treat, but regrettably, does not live up to the Oreo standard - with a final verdict of:<br /><br />---\"Not Enough Cookie\"---<br /><br />The chocolate fudge covering, which is slightly waxy in texture but, oh-so-sweet and satisfying in taste, simply overwhelms the cookie layer. And it is not helped by the smooth peanut butter filling, which is equally flavorful as, but more moist than the standard for a Choco/PB fix: the Reese's cup. Sadly, the creamy PB layer and fudge-chocolate envelope combine to neuter the too-thin, chocolate crunch. After the taste, it's all about proportions and texture.<br /><br />Thicken the wafer by half and let's have another go, Nabisco!<br /><br />Also noteworthy is the amount of crush-proof packaging provided for each cookie. Let's just say, the ratio of packaging to cookies is definitely on the rise.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I will undoubtedly eat myself into a stomach-ache unless they are well-hidden, very soon.

As soon as I switched them to CORE, their coats got much softer and silkier and their eyes cleared up, and I know it's not my imagination. They have had ZERO vomiting or stool problems as well. My cats are on their second bag of CORE and will be happily eating CORE for the forseeable future.<br /><br />Cons: The bag's plastic seal is hard to re-seal, it's expensive, and it has a strong fishy odor which my cats love and I don't mind, but it may bother some humans.

Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables.\" Earth's Best uses certified organic products. The brand offers single-ingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old. Earth's Best products are sold at supermarkets, natural food stores and big box stores nationwide.<br /><br />Plus, my baby girl loves it.

As well, it has a 'grassy' clear taste to it, unlike most green teas I've had. The color was bright lime green when a small amount was used and a olive green when a generous amount of this powder was.

It was okay, but it also says something about how this stuff is packaged.<br /><br />Anyway, I let it chill and popped open a can, expecting something like Mug root beer but less so. It was actually pretty damn good, better than expected! The diet-y flavor is quickly overpowered by one that is decidedly root beer and only makes a brief cameo after the stuff is swallowed. While I would far rather have an A&W or Barq's, this is a very viable alternative if sugar and corn syrup are no longer your friends.<br /><br />The only real downsides I noticed is that there is no vanilla in it, instead it uses four kinds of oil extracts for flavor. Vanilla would have made it a five-star drink and if I have this stuff and some vanilla at the same time, I'll probably combine them.<br />Also, since I kind of assumed (I didn't look, sue me) this would cost a fortune to ship and handle, I found it locally. In the entire area of Arlington Texas, there are four places that sell this according to the Zevia stie. Four.<br /><br />Should you buy some? Sure. It lacks some of the satisfaction of more widely-available root beers, but 'diet' is Latin for 'nothing is as good as it could be'. Good alone, serviceable with Mexican food. TL;DR: "}

It's not the product itself, as much as some company involved in missing or just pawning off -expired pet food- through Amazon.<br /><br />While I think Real Food Toppers make the best freeze-dried Salmon, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CL5S\">Halo Liv-a-Littles Natural Treats for Dogs and Cats, Freeze-Dried Chicken Breast Protein, 2.2oz</a> is the best brand for Chicken in any case. It's much less sinewy and comes in larger chunks. TL;DR: "}

Just because each individual treat was so tiny and there were so many of them in one bag...it would've lasted a lot longer...if my mischeivious pupppy didn't get into the bag when my husband and I were gone...Yes, he loved these treats SO much, maybe too much that he ATE the ENTIRE BAG!!!! I was really concerned at first when we found out he had eaten almost a full bag (I bought the 1 lb bag about 2 weeks ago, so it wasn't completed full but there were still A TON of left in the bag). But, I was a little bit relieved knowing at least this product was made out of all natural and high quality ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start was although the treats were made out of all natural and high quality ingredients, the smell was AWEFUL! My husband wouldn't even reach into the bag to get the treats...and after I gave these treats to my puppy, I had to wash my hands to get the smell off. That was my only complain about this product, otherwise, AWESOME product! I didn't plan on purchasing another 1 pound bag that soon but since my pup ate em all, I'll have to buy it AGAIN! TL;DR: "}

Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity.

{"summary": "Review: Purina Beneful Dog Food", "text": "I have both a dog and a cat.  Defying all expectations, its the dog that's finicky about his food (the cat will attempt to eat anything including the hand petting him).  My dog loves to chew on stuff (furniture, sticks, grass) but when it comes to dog food, he is really picky.  I've been using the Beneful brand of Purina Dog Food with him for at least a year and he loves it.<br /><br />I'd done some research into dog foods when we first moved to that brand.  What attracted us was that there was plenty of protein in the mix (along with egg) and that it was vitamin rich.  Its like the add...I like it because its good for him.  He likes it simply because he likes it.  It should be noted that there is a fair amount of corn and corn-product in the mix.  That's usually a sign of cheap filler...but the protein mix still seems ok.<br /><br />I was concerned about ordering dog food through the mail.  I've seen these bags sometimes rip when being handled but Amazon simply boxed and sent it.  It arrived in perfect condition, wrapped in paper.<br /><br />All in all, I think the product is solid.  My dog likes to eat it and it appears reasonably health for him.  Further, if you are considering ordering online, I believe you will be satisfied with the process.  I was and I'm going to order online from now on! TL;DR: "}
{"summary": "Terrible cat food", "text": "I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn. TL;DR: "}

I'm also seeing less breakage and shedding. At first I thought the oil smelled weird, but it's probably because I don't know what fresh coconut smells like. It smells spicy like pumpkin at first and then I smell coconut and I'm like ooooooh okay, that smells really good. I plan on buying a fresh coconut just so I can know what it smells like. It also feels great on my skin; it soaks in almost instantly and leaves my skins soft while feeling like I didn't put anything on at all. Before I did anything with it, I tasted it, to me it didn't taste like anything, it was only a little though. I'll probably still buy a separate jar for food purposes because of the health benefits.<br />All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will only buy this brand of coconut oil. I bought coconut oil from a natural diy/aromatherapy site that wasn't living up to the known benefits of coconut oil when used in your hair, it also wasn't unrefined and I think it is the cause of seborrheic dermatitis that I'm currently dealing with. But since I've stopped using that coconut oil that issue is just about nonexistent. So make sure what ever oil you are using is unrefined and organic! TL;DR: "}

We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that.

She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well.  She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself.  We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back.  She loves it!  She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).<br /><br />We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy.  We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing.  We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.<br /><br />She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!<br /><br />Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too!

It is not as satisfying at room temperature.<br /><br />The flavor, apart from being strong, is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a Starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can/bottle do.  As a pick-me-up, the drink is appropriate, since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy.  Compared to other similar drinks on the market, sugar content is low (which accounts for its bitterness).<br /><br />For those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee, this beverage is a no-no.

{"summary": "Super value-great supplement!", "text": "After reading several articles maintaining that vitamin supplements are basically a scam, with no positive correlation to health or longevity, I decided to ditch my multivitamin and switch to a natural food supplement instead. The ingredient list in Green Superfood is impressive-I'm not sure how costly it would be to duplicate through juicing but this accomplishes the same goal for me without all the shopping, food prep and cleanup!

My advice to anyone who wants to get the best health result: don't use Green Superfood as a magic bullet that allows you to make multiple bad food choices on a daily basis. Dump the processed sugars, refined flours and sweet drinks, eat as many natural foods and whole grains as possible and over time, your palate will readjust to a normal state.

I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.

{"summary": "Wonderful if you can handle salt", "text": "I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you. TL;DR: "}

It's not really fair to compare it to a $120 premium kit. With that said, I found it to be a solid product with nice flavor.<br /><br />Based on other reviews on Amazon and forums I knew that I shouldn't make this kit to the full 6 gallons or it would be weak and lack body. I only made it to 5 gallons, but I would recommend you make it based on specific gravity rather than volume, because mine came out a little strong. Mine came out to about 13% ABV. On a Cabernet or a more full-bodied wine that would be okay, but it's a little strong for a Riesling. They give you the recommended starting SG, so I would shoot for the middle of that, rather than filling to volume, but probably about 5 1/2 gallons is where you want to be. That will allow you to leave the sediment behind and still fill up a 5 gallon carboy. If you have left over, then keep it in a one gallon jug/carboy and use to top up later in the process.<br /><br />The flavor is still excellent and very drinkable. It was a dry kit, so I sweetened with 1 1/4 cups of wine conditioner. I added a little sorbate after clarifying and before adding the sweetner to avoid fermentation kicking off again. Give it a few days between adding the sorbate and sweetening to make sure fermentation is completely killed off. It's still not very sweet, so I would recommend 1 1/2 cups conditioner/sweetner to get closer to a Washington style Riesling.<br /><br />Overall I think the kit is a true bargain, especially with free super saver shipping. I've since ordered the Shiraz and so far it is exceeding expectations as well. TL;DR: "}

{"summary": "Yummy way to save your teeth", "text": "Let's face it.  No one wants to get bad news from the dentist.  Proper dental care can go a long way to keeping one's teeth for a lifetime.<br /><br />The generation that grew up in the Depression and World War II many times did not have good dental care.  No fluoride, sealants, waterpiks, sonic toothbrushes and the like.  It wasn't uncommon for a person in their 30s to be missing a few teeth.  People generally could look forward to wearing dentures as their teeth became so rotten, the only thing to do was to pull them.<br /><br />Today, we don't have such problems.  And one of the reasons is the use of xylitol to help kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.  The main reason for dental decay is a bacterium called S. Mutans.  This bug feeds on sugars and starches, secreting acids which destroy tooth enamel, which leads to decay and cavities.  There are various ways to defeat this bug, brushing, fluoride, flossing and sealants all have their place.<br /><br />A more modern addition to the decay-preventing fight is xylitol.  It's a sugar alcohol that S. Mutans cannot digest.  Sucking on mints or chewing gum with xylitol a few times a day is a easy and tasty way to curb this nasty bacteria.<br /><br />I've been chewing xylitol gum and eating xylitol mints for a number of years, and I've noticed that my dental problems have really improved.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  My only complaint is that this gum is so delicious, I tend not to ration it to make it last longer.  Try Spry.  Your mouth will thank you for it.  (Maybe not your dentist, though). TL;DR: "}

{"summary": "Not so good", "text": "I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this \"Real Theater\" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is \"bad\" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of \"real\" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be \"artificial\" and \"thick\".  \"Thick\", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent \"real theaters\" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.

Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb.

I had never tried this kind before as it's not one my local grocery stores carry, so I bought a case from amazon.  The first time I baked them, they smelled AMAZING in the oven and I was looking forward to trying them.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the taste -- they were just very, very, very bland.  They tasted to me somewhat like vanilla muffins (I can't taste anything like almonds in them), but actually they didn't have much of a taste at all.<br /><br />With my second box, I added frozen mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries) to the mix -- I think about a cup or cup and a half of the berries (no need to defrost them first).  This improved the taste quite a bit, so I think this muffin mix just needs SOMETHING added.<br /><br />I will continue to add fruit (maybe nuts too at some point) to the 10 boxes I have left, but I doubt that I will order any more.

This is no real (vegan) cheese for one to prepare a sandwich or a vegan pizza.  It is just a little--very tiny little--sprinkle that resembles \"cheese\".  The photograph is quite misleading.  It suggests that we are purchasing something like a cheese pack.  This is not the case.  We are talking about a very, very, tiny bottle (similar to a medication bottle) with not even a handful of \"cheese\" sprinkle.  It is strictly speaking just a seasoning, not actual, melting, substantial vegan cheese.  Since they sell this cheese-seasoning for over 24 dollars (with shipping) for 4 tiny little bottles, one actually pays 6 dollars a piece...!  How's that!?  I tried to give it a final chance and poured an entire of one of those little bottles over a bread slice in the toaster, just to see what would happen with a little heat.  The thing turned into black ashes.  Six dollars directly into the trash container!  I felt deceived, to say the least.  So, if you are looking for actual, substantial, eatable, melting vegan cheese, try elsewhere (for example, in the US, Daya vegan cheese is my first choice--but there are a few other options and more are being launched in the market).  Peace!  Go vegan!  One day, as we hope, there will be no such a thing as vegan cheese any longer, as all cheese will be vegan, and children will not even know, by then, that there was a time in human journey in which we had to struggle to leave our fellow animals in quiet and peace!

I'm not one of those people that have to eat organic, or those guys that have to have the word \"holistic\" on their animals' food. In fact, I usually just buy what's on sale, as long as it meets my personal quality standards. But after trying this, it kind of makes sense why they cost more.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I noticed that it did not have that strong dog food scent that most dog foods I've purchased for my dogs have. It actually smells kind of good, to where I would almost be brave enough to taste it. Second, the kibble size is perfect for my golden retriever puppy. Not too big or small, and it perfect for training treats. In the morning before feeding my dogs in their bowl, I usually let them earn their meal through training, and these are perfectly sized and tasty enough to use for that. The outer layer seems almost coated, so you don't get kibble crumbs in your hand and into your fingertips. Third, and most importantly- It's really good for your dog! Prior to buying our new puppy, I did a lot of research (as a good prospective dog owner should) on raising a healthy dog. One of the biggest things that stuck with me was that you WILL pay for your dogs' health- either in the form of good dog food, or in the form of a vet bill. Have a nice day:) TL;DR: "}

{"summary": "Good Alternative to Candy", "text": "I have been eating Clif Bars for years now, so when I saw that they were making fruit snacks I had to give them a try.  Each stick is individual wrapped and has 70 calories all from Carbs, there is also a gram of Fiber, some Potassium and a few other vitamins and minerals for good measure, so compared to just 100% sugar candy, this is not too bad of a choice.  The sugar is also from Organic Juices so you don't have to worry about pesticides or preservatives or anything like that.<br /><br />As far as the taste, they are a little tart, but not too bad.  They are very chewy and sticky, one of my friends has braces and they had a very hard time eating this without most of it just sticking somewhere in the braces.  So all-in-all, I would recommend these if you like chewy fruit flavored candy and want something better, but you should still use them sparely because eating just carbs only gives a very short energy burst and then without any healthy fats or proteins you crash soon after, so have a handful of nuts or something similar to help balance out the components some.

All the videos I saw and blogs I read said that Boston's really love to chew on stuff, so you should get him a lot of toys. After combing through Amazon and other pet store sites, I finally settled on this one and the Bristle Bone.  Unfortunately, the first one I bought was a medium and way too big for my little guy (the chances you take buying something online), but then I found a \"small\" one in a local pet store and it was perfect.  My little Bandit gets mileage out of this toy and it keeps him busy far longer than any of his other toys.  If you have a similar size pet or smaller, you really need the small as I think the medium will still be too big once he grows up.  There is quite a large difference in the sizes.  Note: The \"Bristle Bone\" small is about the same size as the \"Bouncy Bone\" medium.  I had to order an x-small in that one.  The small size refills fit both although they are not as small as the ones that come with it.  According to the Premier website, they don't come in x-small (which I think is a bit dumb, but whatever, the small works).  Hopefully, this was of help to you. TL;DR: "}

The snotty coffee folks, like myself, roast our own coffee and it is utterly superior.  However it is a royal PITA to tote fresh beans into the office and I'm the only one willing to go to that much trouble for coffee in my office.<br /><br />To solve this little problem, I purchased a Senseo and these pleasant Douwe Egberts Dark pods!  It's a sturdy machine, completely employee-proof, and quite tidy.  The coffee it produces is far better than anything that comes in a can and certainly will give Starbucks a run for their $6 venti's.<br /><br />Think of the DE pods as an easy way to get fresh, hot, pleasant coffee in about 30 seconds.  Use two pods, one dark and one medium for a fuller flavor profile or, if you're a low-caf freak, do one decaf and one caf.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that you've gotta pre-warm the mug you're using if you like hot coffee-and the best way to do this is with some leche in the microwave.  One final tip which out to assuage some of the folks who think the DE's are weak:<br /><br />Run a few seconds of hot water through the machine without a pod inside.  This gets the metal plates wet and hot.  A good thing.  Put your pods on the wet plates and close the machine.  Let it sit for a few seconds.  This lets the coffee get wet and swell a bit.  This is called pre-infusion in the espresso trade and if you pull your 8 oz of pleasure now, it will taste pretty darned good.<br /><br />-J TL;DR: "}

{"summary": "Very goood, much better than expected", "text": "I was really pleasantly surprised with how good this granola was. I am not usually a granola eater. Yes, I know it is supposed to be good for you - but whenever I had eaten it in the past granola just tasted dry. Tasting this and wow - this taste really good! The rolled oats have a nutty flavor with just enough spice. Okay - evaporated cane juice is the second ingredient on the label - so I am sure the sweet flavor is what is really doing it for me.<br />The dark chocolate chunks have a really good flavor - not as bitter a taste as I normally find with dark chocolate.<br />The freeze dried fruit has a nice sharp taste, but this is where my only complaint comes into play - there just aren't many of the fruit chunks in the bag. I was surprised that there were more chocolate chunks than fruit chunks - almost at a ratio of 3 to 1. While this doesn't kill the product for me, the nice contrast you get with the fruit chunks is nice so having more would be good. My young kids also like the sour \"pop\" they get from the fruit chunks so having more for them to munch on would be a bonus.<br />A serving size is 1/4 cup (a little small, this is good and I can eat it by the handful)<br />140 calories per serving<br />55 calories from fat<br />6g total fat<br />2 g dietary fiber<br />6g sugars<br />2 gram protein<br /><br />Nothing in the ingredients worries me - I can pronounce all the words and even the oils and sweetners are okay in my book (evaporated cane juice, soy oil). In addition to the rolled oats there is also spelt, flax seeds, and dried coconuts - things I just wouldn't eat otherwise. Another bonus - Non GMO verified which I am very happy about.<br /><br />The bags are a good size (11.5 oz) with about 10 servings per bag. Since you get 6 packs I would think it would take you a while to get through all of these unless you eat it every single day. I think the price is fair for what you get and I would actually purchase these for the family and feel good eating them. I must admit, I am still shocked about liking granola! TL;DR: "}

I was so thrilled to buy it and get it rushed to my door.  I eagerly awaited for the package to arrive.  Then the day came when it was mine.  I tore open the package and there it was, the evil little bottle itself, complete with silver bullet keychain attached.  I quickly noticed that inside the bullet is a tiny taste testing spoon.  I kind of giggled and figured what the hell, I gotta give this sauce a go.  I put a nice big dab on my finger, enough to cover the tip of my index finger and I licked the sauce off my finger.  Within seconds, I felt the heat coming.  It was insane, it was like someone lit a fire inside my mouth and some maniac was holding a blowtorch on my tongue and on the back of my throat.  I was sweating like crazy, I was panting like a dog on a 100 degree day that was locked inside a car with the windows rolled up.  Never could I ever have imagined how hot this sauce was.  The hottest I had recently tried was Quaker Steak and Lube's Atomic Sauce, and let me tell you, that stuff is mere steak sauce compared to this!  My stomach was killing me, I was on the ground holding my stomach and groaning!  Its beyond hot, its PAINFUL to eat.  Will I do it again?  YES!  Have I since?  Oh yeah.

The Assam really kicks the tea up a notch without overpowering the mint at all.  It has a lovely aroma, and a nice strong flavor.  I can't say whether I felt \"revitalized\" or \"invigorated\" but it tasted great and that's the most important thing.  It has such a great flavor, I tried it as an iced tea and found it was fantastic.  Very refreshing!<br /><br />Since this is marketed as \"health tea,\" I have not been able to find any Yogi flavors in a regular grocery store.  It is available in vitamin shops (online and brick and mortar), and similar outlets.  Though it is a trifle expensive compared to regular tea at almost $4, I would definitely buy it again.

She still has an occassional bout here and there but she's 3 months old and that's to be expected. She has the occasional green bowel movement, which is perfectly normal for a formula supplemented with iron.<br /><br />Regarding the sugar content. I'm not crazy about the sugar but having looked around, every lactose free formula I've seen has some type of sugar as a starting ingredient. I spoke with both Similac and Enfamil and they use sugar because they need to add a carb to replace the removed lactose (which was the sugar stripped from the formula). Babies need loads of carbs so they need to replace the sugar with something to keep the formula balanced.<br /><br />Things I like about this formula\"<br />- Similac's 32oz liquid containers and powder containers are completely BPA free (confirmed this on the phone recently), no other major formula maker can claim that<br />- Easy to find this formula because of Similac's popularity in all forms; RTF, concentrated and powder<br />- It's working to decrease my child's gas, which was obviously due to lactose<br /><br />Things I don't like about this formula:<br />- Sugar content, though I don't think there's anything anyone can do about that... choose higher sugar or a screaming kid<br />- The ready to feed is a little foamy but that's resolved with a couple drops of Mylicon in the bottle<br /><br />I'm keeping my child on this formula for a couple months until her digestive system matures then we'll try a \"regular\" formula again.

Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, \"Your dog is an example of perfect health.\"  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.

{"summary": "Not my mother's oatmeal cookie", "text": "Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only \"fortifications\" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%). TL;DR: "}

Essentia tastes just like regular water; it's not soapy, nor metallic tasting like some would suspect looking at the 9.5 pH label.<br /><br />The whole alkaline water discussion falls into 2 camps that is really beyond the scope of this review.  To summarize, one camp believes it helps against cancer, and promotes longevity etc by following an alkaline diet, the other is calling BS on the psuedoscience of creating \"pure\" alkaline water through osmosis and ionizing water. There is also a large number of middle-of-the-road people that are just using it for convenience to help with GERD instead of popping a pepcid or carrying around a box of bicarb.<br /><br />One important note is that this water is sourced from many sources (including municipal) and is treated water, which does rank lower than water sourced from a natural untreated and untampered spring.  However, Essentia does taste good and whatever other people's stance is on the alkaline water/diet issue, it can't hurt to just drink more water.<br /><br />I love water.

Make sure to follow the instructions, and by that I mean absolutely seal the meat in a container for 15 minutes after a final baste after bringing the meat off the grill. Also, use some common sense - don't have pools of the sauce sitting on the meat when you serve it; the vinegar may overpower the meat then.

It also contains licorice which is on the possible list of supplements that can lower T. Even though the bar has an alkaline ph you might experience heartburn due to the soy isolate. Is it possible the licorice was added to combat the GERD/heartburn as well as enhance the taste? Perhaps, but at what cost?<br /><br />On the positive side I'm not sure I could name a better bar or better tasting bar overall, and again I've tried them all.

The spices are balanced and the tomatoes have the right mix of acid, sweetness and tomato flavor. Look at the ingredient list - everything is natural, no weird chemicals or preservatives.

I also adore plain green tea, Red Rose black tea, Earl Grey, Rooibos with Asian Pear, plain rooibos and many other teas without cream or sugar.  I'm usually very good at reading ingredients and envisioning what a tea will taste and smell like --that's why I risked buying 2 tins. Part of what threw me was the name of the blend -- \"African Autumn\". Somehow I thought there would less of the orange flavor and more of an earthy-nutty flavor. No, I have no idea where that \"made up in my mind\" combo would have come from.  Maybe they should have called this, \"fall fruit basket\"  or something. The tea is not so unpleasant that I won't finish it. I'll have a few more mugs and see if I grow to like it but unlike my yummy chocolate mint, I'll definitely give plenty of my remaining 37 bags of \"African Autmmn\" away one bag at a time.

{"summary": "Superb addition to a dog's daily diet", "text": "This Preference veggie mix has been an important addition to our dogs' daily meals for the past 2 years.  I first began using one of Honest Kitchen's other products, Thrive, when our youngest dog (still a pup) was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia.  I chose to use a bunch of natural supplements/herbs to deal with his joint mobility/pain rather than twice-daily strong prescription meds that would destroy his liver.  It put him off his food though since he didn't care for the taste of some of the supplements; so I tried to add plenty of good-tasting, healthy additions to his kibble (Pure Vita) to encourage him to eat.  The \"Thrive\" dehydrated mix was convenient...meat and veggies together...and I still occasionally use it for that convenience when the dogs are being kenneled or kept by others.  For regular daily use though, I use the Preference veggie base and add my own chicken, turkey, salmon, or bison.  I find it a bit more economical to just add my own protein source since I go through quite a bit (2 dogs, and 1 is huge).  Another thing that I like about the Preference mix is that one of the first two ingredients is alfalfa which has been shown to help with joint inflammation...just what my big guy needs.<br /><br />I usually mix up enough for a couple days worth of meals and just keep it in the fridge.  I just scoop the appropriate amount into each dog's bowl and then mix in the supplements for each pooch.  I then stir in the meat and kibble along with salmon oil.

Try a few drops first, and then add more to taste.  It adds sweetness and cinnamon without adding carbs and bitterness! TL;DR: "}

It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea! TL;DR: "}
{"summary": "Dress it Up, Dress it Down - The Very, Very Best Salad Dressing Ever", "text": "I'm a salad nut and picky about what I put in and on my daily salads.  I grew up on Good Seasons dressings and have used them for well over forty - ok, almost fifty years now  - yes, they have been around that long!  They are the best tasting salad dressings out there, and while I've used many, many other dressings over the years - from bottled to homemade - the Good Seasons Salad Dressing family is my favorite.<br /><br />Back in the 60s I think we always made the dressings with vegetable oil and apple cider vinegar, but after I got out on my own and widened my food horizons, I find I love Good Seasons even more. Vinegar is the big secret with these dressings - change the type of vinegar you use and you dramatically change the flavor!  In the 80s I started using red wine and white wine vinegars, which gave it a whole new taste.  In the 90s Basalmic vinegar was the way to go and my foodie friends were never so impressed!  Now my vinegar of choice is a rice vinegar, especially with the Zesty Italian and this flavor - Garlic and Herb.  But other vinegars are great too - try it with malt vinegar for a change of pace.<br /><br />My other trick is that I now make my dressing with a healthier canola oil, rather than the vegetable oil of the old days.  I've also made it with olive oils, but I don't use olive oil as a general rule, only because the oil solidifies in the refrigerator and you have to take it out ahead of time to soften it.  I'm just not that good at planning ahead, so I'll stick with canola.  I also use a bit more of both the oil and vinegar than the package recommends - I like the taste a bit better and I get a wee bit more dressing for each package.<br /><br />And now that I've found my favorite salad dressing on Amazon, life just got better yet.  The prices in the grocery stores had gone way up over the years to over $2.25 a pack, but now I can buy 16 to 24 packages of dressing for over a buck per package less.  Thanks Amazon! TL;DR: "}

Nothing wrong with that but if the coffee isn't good, the good deeds don't matter to me.  After tasting it, I found that the coffee IS good.  The blend I received was \"Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe\" and it is very enjoyable.  The coffee is packaged in individually sealed coffee in their own filter packets.  Having an ample supply at home of other good coffee (and after enjoying a weekend of Marley Coffee) I decided that this was the coffee to take on the road.  I have been using motel coffee makers for years with the ground coffee I took with my wife and I.  We even bring our own measuring spoons and filters.  Alas, the motel coffee-makers have shrunk in size and I can't make a good job of making my own coffee.  These packets are just the right size for those dinky coffee-makers so I'm taking Marley Coffee on the road.  In fact, I did just that last weekend.  I even threw an extra packet in my coat pocket.  Good thing too because I had put the other packets in a different bag which left me with the local mediocrity.  Why the long story?

Definitely the spices are unique when balanced with the sweet potato flavor.

They're healthy and you might find a nice occasional alternative to the not-so-healthy stuff. Hey, if it tastes good, why not? One thing these chips prove is that not all \"health food\" has to taste bland or nasty. Sort of like spelt bread and Newman's ginger cookies, and Izze's luscious pear soda.

The first is he seems to eat more of this food to feel satisfied.  Generally we free-feed at our house and I fill the bowl as it's empty (or as he clangs on it letting me know it is empty of food).  However I do feel like with this food I have to fill it twice as often.  It's hard to tell if it is because it is less nutritionally dense and therefore less satisfying or if he enjoys the flavor better and therefore wants more of it than he does with something like Buffalo Blue.<br /><br />The other thing I don't care for, personally, is the ingredients list.

Coconut water is awesome in terms of being nutritious and refreshing, and sodas of course don't hold a candle to it. I have tried both the Zico 'natural' (as in no added flavor) and the Zico mango flavored, and must say that the mango flavored one wins hands down. The regular one has a slightly 'cooked' or 'boiled' taste to it (as packaged coconut water is pasteurized), and maybe the mango flavor covers that in the other one. Tastes great whether cool or cold; probably better the colder it is. The mango flavor is very delicate, and does not take away from the coconut water itself, somehow enhancing it and making it even more delicious. Plus, the first time I got this the price was fantastic, 8 dollars off from the usual 24 due to a lightning deal, making this even sweeter (no pun intended, the coconut water has only a touch of sweetness, no added sugar - just the right, natural amount). Hopefully this will be back in stock soon so I can 'subscribe and save' to keep the price low. TL;DR: "}

Additionally there is no mention of how much water to use with each pod, or whether it is a single or four cup serving.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once that was settled (It is recommended between 6oz and 8oz of water per pod and it can be used in any traditional drip coffee machine, or used in the same fashion as a tea bag)... I was ultimately surprised and delighted at how dark and rich the resulting coffee looked. I brewed it at full strength the first time, to see what its got. I don't normally like my coffee super strong, but I was overwhelmed with the delicious aroma of this product. The first waft was clearly rich and nutty, although the packaging says exotic floral and berry. The taste was beyond anything I could hope for. I was shocked at how much flavor this coffee contained since it is also very smooth without being bitter. The second time I brewed this coffee, using the tea bag method and hot water, I actually let it soak until I was finished dressing for work, so around 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind I do not usually care for coffee that is overpoweringly strong, but the addition time only created a more intense flavor and aroma which, after only two experiences with it, I found myself craving a repeat experience. I added a little Splenda and plain creamer to it and rather than masking the flavor, the coffee-nutty-berry flavor came through with perfection.<br /><br />All in all I would say this coffee has performed better than any other brand of coffee I have had my hands on in the last year or two... which is saying something since I am considered fairly obsessed with quality coffee. The price is around sixty-three cents per cup and is MORE than worth it!! TL;DR: "}

Right there the price becomes reasonable.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is fairly agreeable, too; Peppermint is never a bad way to go when flavoring medicinal/therapeutical herbs. I usually drop in an extra bag of chamomile when steeping Valerian, so that helps with the flavor, too.<br /><br />Personally speaking, I feel the effects of Valerian tea much faster than, say, capsules of Valerian root one might buy at a natural foods store. I can recommend this as a soothing alternative to whatever you might normally drink to relax at the end of the day.<br /><br />If I had to list any specific concern, it would be the intensely vivid dreams that Valerian seems to produce from time to time, but nothing so mind-bending that I would stop drinking the tea.<br /><br />Lastly, avoid heavy or daily usage, beacuse the build-up in your system can lead to problems.

I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good.

{"summary": "Puts ferrets at risk for insulinoma", "text": "Unfortunately, while ferrets LOVE these treats, they may put ferrets' health at risk. Ferrets are carnivorous, requiring quality proteins and fats, and sugar and carbohydrates are exceptionally bad for ferrets and puts them at great risk for a condition called insulinoma. Before we knew about diet and insulinoma in ferrets, we treated our ferrets to these per the instructions on the package and never really read the ingredients, trusting that a company marketing a product for ferrets would know what is safe and healthy to feed them. At about 4-5 years of age, all of our ferrets began displaying some strange symptoms: wobbly gait, staring off into space, increased urination, and later lethargy, extreme weight loss, inability to stand or walk at all, glazed eyes, and eventually a slow, painful death after 1-2 months of symptoms. It was horrifying, and agonizing to watch and have veterinarians say there is nothing that can be done at this stage. After consulting with many veterinarians after multiple ferrets displayed these same symptoms, we were able to narrow down exactly what was going on: insulinoma, caused by supplementing our ferret's diets with treats containing sugar and grains. We beat ourselves up over having caused our ferrets to live shortened lives by 1-2+ years just because we wanted to spoil them. These treats contain sugar as the first ingredient, which ferrets cannot properly metabolize. PLEASE, read up on the condition called insulinoma in ferrets and its link to sugar and carbohydrates in their diet, and come to an educated decision on what to feed your ferrets. We wish we had.

I'm ok with the amount of food it produces since I don't like to make big batches due to freezer space.

I make a week's worth of baby food, and when the machine is not in use I let the water chamber and other parts air dry.

It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs.

This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG.  They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber.  (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.

Fresh Fageolets are occasionally available in the summer. They range from creamy white to light green.<br /><br />Fageolets are removed from the pod when tender and just maturing. This bean of French origin is grown in the fertile soil of California. Its versatile flavor compliments lamb, as well as fish and chicken.<br /><br />Fageolets are usually prepared simply, in order to show their delicate flavor. Fageolets are a great source of fiber.<br /><br />Preparation:<br /><br />Soak in cold water overnight. Rinse thoroughly. In a saucepan boil 1 1/2 cups water. Add 1/2 fageolets and 1 tsp. salt to the water and simmer slowly until water is absorbed(about 1 hour). Makes 3-4 servings.<br /><br />If you can't find them, substitute navy beans instead. TL;DR: "}

Luckily I have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer, which powered through the thick batter with ease.<br /><br />I used a cake pan so I'd have thinner brownies.

I have always been a fan of granola bars, oatmeal, and, of course, chocolate, but I never expected to enjoy this food quite as much as I did.  The taste is not merely the blandness of oats or the sugary sweetness of the chocolate but a wonderful combination of the two, neither of which comes across as overpowering but as a subtle, healthy snack for one to eat.  If you are interested in this product, you might also be most interested to note the excessive fiber content, which is another of granola's additional benefits.<br /><br />Any complaint I have regarding the product is purely logistical.  Let's be honest: eating loose, bulk granola isn't easy.  I dropped as much on my floor as I put in my mouth.  I suppose the most effective method of eating the granola would be to put it in a bowl and spoon it like cereal, but that eliminates the ability for the product to be carried around for a snack, taken camping, etc.  While one cannot as easily control the portion size of granola bars, they remain a much easier and more effective method of consumption than loose granola.

After two days he came down with K9 influenza and was on all sorts of medicine. We had to give him water with a turkey baster. After almost a month of pills and force feeding him canned food, he kicked his virus, but because his body was still recovering and he was growing, he needed the best food he could get. I read about Taste of the Wild on a dog food review site and found it at a specialty store near my work. I got him a bag and he went CRAZY! I swear he could smell it through the bag! He now gobbles it down, then drags his dish across the kitchen begging for more! I swear, he can't get enough! This food increased not only his health, but his coat is beautiful, his energy level is back and he is finally acting like the puppy he didn't get to be! I truly believe this food helped him incredible. No fillers, no byproduct, it has everything he needs. Boomer gives it two paws up! TL;DR: "}

More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend.<br /><br />We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen.<br /><br />Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta.

And, while no one expects olives to be low-sodium, the pitted ones soak up so much that some of them actually taste as though you placed a teaspoon of salt in your mouth.

I've enjoyed it in tea, on biscuits, and on yummy sopaipillas. Honey really seems to bring out the wonderful flavor of good buttermilk biscuits and sopaipillas. (And if you've never had sopaipillas, RUN, don't walk to the Great Southwest and try them. They make your eyes roll back they are so good) ... but I digress.<br /><br />The key to honey on these great American foods is that it has to be a delicate flavored honey to complement rather than overpower them...which is what I have always experienced with these little single-serve packets of honey ... a lovely golden liquid that melts in your mouth, and is chosen for its mild flavor for exactly the use I have described. But, to put it in the vernacular, this ain't that. This honey is dark, and VERY strong. When the box arrived from Amazon today, I made a batch of buttermilk biscuits and sat down to enjoy a real treat. Unfortunately, it was no treat at all. The strong flavor of this honey overpowered the delicate flavor of the biscuits. It was very disappointing.<br /><br />So, if like me, you are hoping for the light golden sweetness usually provided by these little cups, look elsewhere, lest you be disappointed too. But if you like strong honey, like say, buckwheat, and you want the convenience of single serving cups, then this is for you. TL;DR: "}

I did a comparison shop at Wally World and picked up the Hershey's and Dove dark sugar free and the high (86%) but sugar-included Ghirardelli's.<br /><br />I eat chocolate by letting it slowly melt in my mouth to make it last longer and get maximum taste. Never chew on it. My conclusions:<br /><br />The Dove is noticeably smoother than the Hershey's and has smaller pieces but is more expensive and melts far too fast. I had to repeatedly check that it was dark chocolate, though because it lacks the required somewhat bitter dark taste.<br /><br />The Hershey's is very good and melts nice and slowly. It does not have as nice a taste as its sugary counterpart but comes VERY close and is worth getting.<br /><br />The Ghirardelli is true dark chocolate with the typical real dark bitter taste as it should have. However, the pieces are bigger so you have to break it up but it does melt nice and slowly.<br /><br />At a little under $2 at Wally World, the Hershey's is the best buy for the amount and taste. Amazon, your price needs to come down a bit. I'd rather buy from you but even 12 packs are higher than Wally's single bag on a per bag basis. Too bad Hershey doesn't want to provide bigger bags of this product.<br /><br />One nice thing - the sugar alcohol has a laxative effect so you tend to not overdo it or you get punished later!

{"summary": "Great product, good supplier, fair price", "text": "I love Devil Dogs. Unfortunately, here in the Seattle area they are not for sale. For the last few years I have odered them online. The product you are viewing is sold by an affiliate merchant with Amazon. Shipping is done by the seller. I wouldn't be surprised if the seller buys the Devil Dogs at a local supermarket, boxes them, and ships. In terms of the product itself, well Devil Dogs are really wonderful. This review is more about buying them than extolling their value as a treat.<br /><br />The first thing to know is that Drakes Cakes short dates Devil Dogs. They have an expiration date less than a month after manufacture. This is their way of assuring freshness. Expect the product you receive from this vendor to have a week or less of time before the \"sell before\" date. This is not a problem. As long as you get them before the sell-by date, you will be fine. One really nice thing about this product is that you can safely freeze them in their package. I just open the carton, unpack, the retail packs and put them in the freezer. I then pull them out one box at a time as needed. They don't get stale that way and the taste does not change due to freezing.<br /><br />As far as this seller goes, shipping is pompt. In this case they came in a Priority Mail package. No damage of any kind. My one complaint is the shipping cost. As I recall it is nearly $8 per order of 6. Now that isn't too bad all things considered. What did bother me is that when I priced a double order (12 retail packs), the shipping price doubled! There is no savings if you order more. What this means to me is that I will only order 6 boxes at a time. So, if you figure the cost: $26 for the product and $8 for shipping, you are paying $34, which turns out to be about 71 cents each. Well worth it to me.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great treat, fairly priced, and promptly shipped. A good deal all around. TL;DR: "}

{"summary": "Good product, but very expensive.", "text": "I just rescued a cat and have been trying to find a good food for him. I got him about 3 months ago. He was overweight and not very active. I had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness, which he really enjoyed. His coat was better and he was losing weight and being more active. Then I read about how canned food is better for cats, because of the extra moisture, so I ordered Instinct for him. He's been on it for a month, and I haven't noticed any added benefits over the less expensive Blue Buffalo. Instinct canned food is so much more expensive, but I would have been willing to keep him on it if I had noticed a significant weight loss or behavior change, which I didn't. I think I'll be getting him the Blue Buffalo again. If you can afford to feed instinct canned food to your cat, it is a really high quality food. I'm just not sure it's worth the money.<br /><br />One tip, though, if you are trying to help your cat lose weight, definitely go with a grain-free food. He was on a Purina Prescription weight loss food when I brought him home. When I switched to grain-free, I noticed a huge difference in just a week. One big plus, the cat box doesn't fill up as fast because he eats less of the food, since it has fewer fillers and more nutrients. TL;DR: "}

We're beginning to experiment with cooking our breads in the Global Sun Oven (also purchased here at Amazon), for those times when the power might not be available in an blackout or an storm-driven outage.

So far, no staining on her bedding at all.

The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised.

The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.

I recommend putting a sheet of foil on the pizzaz plate/or pizza pan if cooking in the oven.  I mixed the Chebe in a Kitchen Aid and then rolled it out into a thin circle (we like thinner crusts).  Unlike most Gluten Free pizza crust mixes, Chebe's actually stays thin.  It doesn't bake up like a cake, like the Gluten Free Pantry brand does.  We use WalMart brand pizza sauce (GF) and cheese, and put on the toppings of our choice.  It cooks perfectly and tastes great.  There are italian spices already in the mix that taste delicious, you just add egg, oil, and parmesan cheese.  It's quick and simple!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Cooks flat as a pizza crust should<br />- Mix tastes great with spices infused<br />- Works best for pizza, sandwiches, and wraps<br />- Makes two 12-14\", thin crust pizzas (we usually eat one and put the 2nd crust in a baggie in the fridge to make a few days later)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Chebe used to hide their ingredients lists in the recipe, but this new packaging actually lists it at the top, which is helpful!<br />- Can't think of anything else...it's that good.<br /><br />If you like this, I also recommend the Cinnamon Rolls.

The 7\u00bd-year-old is a 92-lb Rott/Shep. Given her size, the recommendation is 4 cups a day. This serving size is not needed in our case with this food. She eats 2\u00bd cups at dinnertime and is very happy. She doesn't poke around the food bag or tip her bowl over as a request for more. Our 2-year-old is a 40-lb Chow mix that is as skinny as her breed comes.

It left a bit of powder around the stovetop so take extra care to open slowly and/or over the pot/pan where you are mixing the curry to avoid the extra cleanup.  Bon appetit! TL;DR: "}

But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid.

I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost \"dust\". The \"dust\" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days.

Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term \"all about tuna fish\".

It is fairly sweet and has a smooth, peanut butter-like texture.<br /><br />I didn't want to put it on a salty cracker and didn't have any plain/neutral biscuit type crackers and I didn't really need to add the calories, so I developed the habit of just eating a spoonful of it when I needed a little treat or dessert. It would be good on a plain bagel or English muffin, but it is just great to have a spoonful by itself once in a while.<br /><br />I came to Amazon and found a good deal and bought several jars and gave them out at Christmas. Then I tried to take one to my sister and my jar got confiscated at the airport security check!  I was so upset. They considered it (same consistency of peanut butter) a \"gel\" and took my lovely gift away.<br /><br />When I got back from my trip I came back to Amazon to order more and found the best deal -- buy it here through Vitacost for $3.70 a jar. Shipping is $4.99 - no matter the quantity. Much better than the $9 plus a jar from the other sellers and Amazon Prime. I just ordered 10 more jars for a total of $41.99. They make great gifts. I can't imagine anyone not loving Biscoff Spread - unless they absolutely hate anything sweet.<br /><br />One tablespoon is 89 calories and 6 grams of fat, lower than peanut butter and most days just one tablespoon is very satisfying.

Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.

A number of thins didn't survive the shipping so lots of broken pieces, which were actually easier to eat than the full cookie.

I set it on my pant leg and was rewarded with lots of crumbs. But the taste is pleasing, nice blueberry hints and though I didn't get the brown sugar flavor as much as I wanted to, it's still sweet enough to satisfy a craving. Each thin is approximately 46 calories, which does seem a bit high given such a small snack, but I would definitely buy them as a nice cookie-alternative. TL;DR: "}

A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed.

Gluten-free mixes for the most part are horrible and this used to be exceptional not only in taste but in texture.<br /><br />To my great surprise and disappointment the ingredients have been reformulated. I recently reordered two cases of this mix; same packaging, etc. so no reason to suspect anything had changed.<br /><br />Well, as I was baking yesterday I noticed the \"new\" mix was a different color, in comparison to the \"old\" mix (I still had 3 older bags) and consistency when stirring was like mixing chalk powder in water.<br /><br />As the muffins were baking, the \"old\" batch mix was baking beautifully (nice golden brown) but in comparison the \"new\" batch mix did not appear to be baking (still pale white coloring after 20 minutes in the oven).<br /><br />So here's the scoop, the bag is now 13.5 ounces versus what was 16 ounces. There was no disclosure on the bag stating this major change.  In addition, many of the key taste ingredients have been eliminated such as vanilla bean powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The base ingredient was brown rice flour but is now whole grain brown rice flour (pale bland flour).  Now I know why the \"new\" product is bland! The taste is now gritty and in essence unpalatable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have one unopened case but will not be able to return it; Amazon does not allow food product returns. I believe the manufacturer should have disclosed all of these changes clearly on the packaging thus allowing consumers (like me) the option of purchasing or not.  If I had known the mix was reformulated I never would have reordered. Base cost per bag including tax is $4.84.  But keep in mind that your cost is slightly higher because you must add oil, sugar and any other ingredient i.e. blueberries, nuts, etc. to make the \"finished\" product.<br /><br />My recommendation, do not buy this reformulated product.

Kids will find the plastic wrapper easy to open, and not too hard to crimp shut should they want to save half for later, which they might: dried fruits are always more intense than fresh, and this snack packs a wallop of organic apple puree and organic fruit flavors, bound together with organic apple juice and pectin.  That is some rarified fruity madness.<br />I don't have kids, but if I did I'd sneak these into their backpacks every morning; instead, I keep these in the car and in my purse, for when I get so busy I forget to eat. It happens. I'm blonde. My husband snacks on them before *and* after meals; I can be convinced of their desert-worthiness with a hunk of high grade chocolate sharing their plate.<br />These snacks are a good source of potassium (great for writer's cramp or lost-weekend-recovery), with almost no sodium and very little sugar.  At 70 calories each, they're just the thing when you're too hungry to decide what you want to eat for dinner. Highly recommended. TL;DR: "}
{"summary": "Super Bubble is great, but box from Amazon not that great.", "text": "I've purchaesed twice so far and in both boxes the gum was really hard.  Product is great, but I wouldn't purchase again through amazon due to it being so hard to chew. TL;DR: "}
